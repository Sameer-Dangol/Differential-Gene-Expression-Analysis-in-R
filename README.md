# Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis-in-R

Welcome!

Note: This repository will host all the necessary codes and files required for our project completion.

Before actively being involved, please learn the basics of GitHub, specifically branches, pull requests and merging (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

Current Goals:

1. Installing Bioconductor in R (https://www.bioconductor.org/install/)

2. Learn to commit a R code to Github.

3. Complete R Workshop: RNA-seq Airway Data and Differential Expression Analysis. (https://programming-workshops.readthedocs.io/en/v2018.07/workshops/04_R/Workshop_R_Solution.html#manipulate-and-visualize-results)
